<h1>All About Turtles</h1>
<p>	Turtles are amazing animals. Turtles  are small, slow, and cute! I think turtles are great because you can keep them in your own little aquarium! There are many different types of turtles. Many people confuse turtles for tortoises, the difference is that tortoises live on land, but turtles live in water. Turtles only come on land when birth and when laying eggs. I love turtles. What do you think is your favorite animal?</p>
